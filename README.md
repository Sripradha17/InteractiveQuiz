#🧠 Interactive Quiz App
An engaging, dynamic, and educational web-based quiz application built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This app allows users to select a subject, choose a category within that subject, pick a difficulty level, and answer a series of timed multiple-choice questions. Scores are tracked, and fun facts or explanations are displayed after each question.



#🚀 Features
🎯 Multiple Subjects: Quiz data is loaded per subject (e.g., Math, Science, etc.)

📂 Category Selection: Subjects contain multiple categories (e.g., Algebra, Geometry, etc.)

📊 Difficulty Levels: Each category includes multiple difficulty levels like Easy, Medium, Hard, and Very Hard.

⏳ Timed Questions: Each question has a countdown timer based on its difficulty.

✅ Answer Feedback: Instant feedback with correct answer and a fun fact or explanation.

🏁 Final Score Summary: Score is displayed at the end of the quiz.

🧼 Clean UI: Modal-based UI keeps the experience focused and distraction-free.

🔁 Retry Option: Users can go back and reselect categories or levels after finishing a quiz.

🛠️ How It Works
1. Load a Subject
The quiz starts when a subject button is clicked. It fetches the corresponding JSON file from the /questions/ directory:

`fetch(`../questions/${subject}.json`)`

2. Choose a Category
Each subject JSON is structured with categories (e.g., Algebra, Geometry), which the user selects next.

`
{
  "Algebra": {
    "levels": {
      "Easy": [...],
      "Medium": [...],
      "Hard": [...]
    }
  }
}
`

3. Pick a Difficulty Level
After selecting a category, the user picks a difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard, Very Hard), which adjusts the question timer:

`
if (level === "Easy") timeLimit = 10;
else if (level === "Medium") timeLimit = 20;
// ...
`

4. Answer Questions
Questions are displayed one at a time with multiple-choice options. The timer counts down, and feedback is provided after answering:

✅ Correct answer: green

❌ Wrong answer: red

⏰ Time’s up: feedback shown

Fun facts or explanations are displayed if available.

5. Quiz Completion
At the end of the quiz, a summary modal shows the user’s final score and a button to return to the category selection.

📦 Sample JSON Format

`
{
  "Algebra": {
    "levels": {
      "Easy": [
        {
          "question": "What is 2 + 2?",
          "options": ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
          "answer": "4",
          "explanation": "Basic addition shows 2 + 2 = 4.",
          "fun_fact": "Did you know? In binary, 2 + 2 is 100!"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
`
